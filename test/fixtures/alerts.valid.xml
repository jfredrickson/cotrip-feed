        <alert:Description>Starting in early September, crews on this project will begin making improvements to an 18-mile stretch of Interstate 25 known as &quot;The Gap,&quot; which starts south of Castle Rock and continues to Monument. In addition to building one new lane in each direction of I-25, this project will provide the following benefits:   Safety: Crews will widen shoulders outside and inside the travel lanes for vehicle pull-off and emergency response. This improvement will also help with drainage.  Driver choice: After crews add an Express Lane in each direction of I-25, drivers will have the choice to use the Express Lane for a reliable trip in exchange for a variable toll, or to use one of the two general-purpose lanes for free. Carpoolers (vehicles with three or more people) can ride the Express Lane for free.  Wildlife safety: Crews will construct five new wildlife crossings and install deer fencing.  Improved pavement: Crews will add a new overlay to the existing pavement for a smoother ride.  Improved infrastructure: Crews will repair or replace four bridges, and extend ramps.  Improved truck access: Crews will add truck climbing lanes near Monument Hill and the Greenland exit.  Advanced technology: Crews will modernize communications and power along the corridor to enable advanced technology.</alert:Description>

        <alert:Description>Expansion of the roadway where it intersects US 287.  The expansion will include the addition of right and left turn lanes, acceleration lanes, bike lanes, and widening shoulders east and west of the intersection, with realignment of the roadway centerline.  Portions of asphalt and concrete pavement will be will be replaced from 1200 feet west of the intersection to 500 feet east of 109th St.  Additional improvements will take place east of 287/Isabelle intersection at the junction of N. 109th St where the pavement removal and replacement will extend North on 109th St for 300 feet.  The intersection will include a new traffic signal along with improved roadway lighting.  Additionally, roadside ditches will be graded along the length of improvements to ensure proper drainage throughout the project with new storm drainage piping.</alert:Description>

Specifically, the work zones are at these locations: 1) on CO 145 at mile point (MP) 24.5, which is about 12 miles north of Dolores in Montezuma County; 2) on CO 145 at MP 49, about three miles north of Rico in Dolores County; 3) on US 550 at MP 90, two miles south of Ouray in Ouray County. The work involves a ‘deep patch’ repair rock buttress work on CO 145, MP 24.5; and retaining wall removal and replacement with crib wall systems at CO 145, MP 49 and US 550 MP 90.</alert:Description>

        <alert:Description>The project consists of overlaying the existing roadway with 2.5 inches of hot mix asphalt and in places patching degraded areas. In addition, various structures will receive rehabilitation work. This will include bridge railing, guardrail, signing, delineators, and striping. This will improve the roadway function and make it safer for traffic.</alert:Description>

        <alert:Headline>&lt;b&gt;CO 69 Northbound Colorado Highway 69 between the towns of Westcliffe and Hillside in Custer County (Milemarker 58.7-71.58)&lt;/b&gt; (through December 2020)</alert:Headline>
        <alert:Description>This project entails resurfacing from Westcliffe to Hillside on CO 69 from MP 58.70 to MP 71.58. Resurfacing includes 2 inches of milling and 2 inches of asphalt pavement overlay in town of Wescliffe, MP 58.70 to MP 59.00. For the rest of the project, the resurfacing consists of 2.5 inches of asphalt pavement overlay. Other work includes replacing just under 7,000 linear feet of guardrail, adding/replacing over 150 signs, replacing all delineators, and Class 2 bridge deck repair with waterproofing membrane on two bridges. The project also includes 1/4 mile of restriping/adding bike lanes on SH 96 in Westcliffe, MP 0.0 to MP 0.26.</alert:Description>

        <alert:Description>An intersection improvement will be constructed in the Town of Elizabeth, CO. Currently County Road 13 and Elizabeth Street form two T-Intersections approximately 300 feet apart from each other. This project will realign the County Road 13 leg to the Elizabeth Street location, provide necessary widening on SH 86 and Elizabeth Street to accommodate the new intersection design, and reduce two traffic signal locations into one. The project will help to alleviate traffic congestion and make this area safer by reducing rear end vehicle accidents.</alert:Description>

        <alert:Description>CDOT will improve South Federal Boulevard from Alameda Avenue to Vassar Avenue by installing raised medians. Work will include removal of pavement, curb and gutter, median installation, signing and striping. This project will provide improved safety to motorists and pedestrians. Raised medians provide refuge islands that allow pedestrians to cross on direction of traffic at a time, wait in the island of the raised median and then cross the other direction of traffic when prompted. The raised medians will reduce car crashes, reduce vehicle speeds and decrease the rate and severity of crashes.</alert:Description>

        <alert:Description>This project entails resurfacing from Westcliffe to Hillside on CO 69 from MP 58.70 to MP 71.58. Resurfacing includes 2 inches of milling and 2 inches of asphalt pavement overlay in town of Wescliffe, MP 58.70 to MP 59.00. For the rest of the project, the resurfacing consists of 2.5 inches of asphalt pavement overlay. Other work includes replacing just under 7,000 linear feet of guardrail, adding/replacing over 150 signs, replacing all delineators, and Class 2 bridge deck repair with waterproofing membrane on two bridges. The project also includes 1/4 mile of restriping/adding bike lanes on SH 96 in Westcliffe, MP 0.0 to MP 0.26.</alert:Description>

        <alert:Description>The project repairs and makes safety improvements on two highways. Specifically, the work zones are at these locations: 1) on CO 145 at mile point (MP) 24.5, which is about 12 miles north of Dolores in Montezuma County; 2) on CO 145 at MP 49, about three miles north of Rico in Dolores County; 3) on US 550 at MP 90, two miles south of Ouray in Ouray County. The work involves a ‘deep patch’ repair rock buttress work on CO 145, MP 24.5; and retaining wall removal and replacement with crib wall systems at CO 145, MP 49 and US 550 MP 90.</alert:Description>

        <alert:Description>The project repairs and makes safety improvements on two highways. Specifically, the work zones are at these locations: 1) on CO 145 at mile point (MP) 24.5, which is about 12 miles north of Dolores in Montezuma County; 2) on CO 145 at MP 49, about three miles north of Rico in Dolores County; 3) on US 550 at MP 90, two miles south of Ouray in Ouray County. The work involves a ‘deep patch’ repair rock buttress work on CO 145, MP 24.5; and retaining wall removal and replacement with crib wall systems at CO 145, MP 49 and US 550 MP 90.</alert:Description>
